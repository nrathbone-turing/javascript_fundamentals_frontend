# Consecutive Substrings

## Learning Goals

- Practice algorithmic problem solving

## Instructions

Given a string, return all consecutive substrings within that string consisting
of at least one character. Substrings should be returned in the order in which
they appear.

Note than in the string `'abc'`, `'ac'` is not a consecutive substring.

The input string will have a length of 0 or more.

```txt
Input: 'abc'
Output: ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'b', 'bc', 'c']

Input: 'a'
Output: ['a']
```

## Before you start coding

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!
6. Determine Big(O)

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**

## How to run your own tests

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `node <filename>.js`

## How to run our tests

### JavaScript

1. `cd` into the javascript folder
2. `npm i`
3. `npm test`
