# Summative Lab instructions

This lab combines these techniques to create a Single Page Application's (SPA) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will build interactive, data-driven web applications that align with industry standards. The project will demonstrate proficiency in building an interactive web page that communicates with a public API and provide meaningful user interactions. By the end, you’ll have developed a functional, modern web application and gained critical web development skills.

## The Scenario 

Wordly, an online language learning platform, wants to improve its user experience by providing an interactive dictionary feature. This feature will allow users to search for words, view their definitions, and save their favorite terms for future reference—all on a single page without refreshing. The goal is to create a fast, user-friendly, and dynamic dictionary interface that integrates seamlessly with Wordly’s language tools.

As a developer for Wordly, you are tasked with building a Single Page Application (SPA) for the dictionary. You will build an SPA that enables users to search for a word and retrieve information such as pronunciation, definitions, synonyms, and source details.

* **Search for Words:** Allow users to input a word into an HTML form and fetch its definition from an external dictionary API.
* **Display Definitions:** Dynamically show the word’s definition, part of speech, and example usage on the same page without a reload.
* **Style the Page:** Use JavaScript to dynamically update the CSS, highlighting saved words or changing themes for better readability.
* **Error Handling:** Display an error message if a word is not found or if the API request fails.

## Instructions

In this lab, you will create a Single Page Application (SPA) that follows modern web development practices, giving you hands-on experience with essential skills. Implementing event listeners to make your application interactive, such as responding to button clicks or form submissions. Use fetch requests to interact with APIs, enabling dynamic content updates by retrieving or sending data to external services. Finally, manipulate HTML and CSS elements with JavaScript to update the page dynamically, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

### Task 1: Define the Problem

1. Define what user features will be included in the app:
    * Search functionality, for a word.
    * Displaying pronunciation, definitions, and synonyms.
    * Providing audio playback for pronunciation.

2. Identify the API tool to use for word lookup (e.g., Free Dictionary APILinks to an external site.).
3. Develop a data structure provided by the API for definitions, synonyms, pronunciation, etc.

### Task 2: Determine the Design

In this step it is important to break out the different coding languages you will be using and preparing how to design this page.

1. **HTML - Create a single HTML file with:**
    * A search bar (form with an input and submit button).
    * A section to display results.
    * Include placeholder elements for dynamic content like word definitions and audio playback.

2. **CSS - Use this to design and style the page:**
    * Design the page layout and style.
    * Use classes or IDs to style the search bar and results section.

3. **JavaScript - Plan functions for the following features:**
    * Fetching data from the API.
    * Parsing and displaying the fetched data.
    * Handling user input and events.

### Task 3: Develop the Code

In this step you will need to develop the code and integrate all the features you will need.
1. **HTML Setup:**
    * Write semantic HTML for structure.
    * Include accessible attributes (e.g., aria-labels) for better usability.

2. **CSS Styling:**
    * Style the form and results section for an appealing user interface.
    * Use hover effects or animations to enhance interactivity.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
    * Use fetch to request data from the dictionary API.
    * Parse the API response to extract relevant details (definitions, synonyms, pronunciation).
    * Update the DOM dynamically with the fetched data.
    * Add event listeners to handle form submission and user actions.

### Task 4: Test and Refine

1. **Test the app for:**
    * Valid word searches (ensure all data displays correctly).
    * Words without synonyms or pronunciation (handle gracefully with fallback messages).
    * Invalid inputs or empty search queries.

2. **Debug any errors and refine the code for clarity and performance.**

### Task 5: Document and Maintain

1. **Version Control:** Use version control to track changes. This allows for easy updates, collaborative editing, and the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary.
2. **Regular Updates and Reviews:** Schedule regular reviews and updates for code to ensure content remains relevant, accurate, and aligned with the latest Javascript developments and industry practices.
3. **Documentation and Examples Repository:** Maintain a centralized repository containing all lab documents, example code, and solutions.
